    <p>A new luxury realtor operating in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico needed initial branding and website that appealed to English speaking tourists.</p>
<p>In this part of Mexico many websites are ancient in their presentation and layout, so we created a beautiful image heavy site that meets the expectations and aesthetics of their global audience including a WhatsApp enabled AI chatbot that provides 24/7 sales and support in hundreds of languages</p>    
<p>To facilitate listings from multiple MLS providers with different database structures we created a heavily customized Wordpress theme</p>

          <h3>Where we started</h3>
          <p>📍 <strong>Client:</strong> Alpenglow</p>
          <p>
            Alpenglow is a new luxury real estate agency based in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, serving international clients—
            especially English-speaking buyers exploring second homes and vacation properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a market where many real estate sites feel dated or slow, the challenge was to build a platform that looked
            global, performed locally, and guided clients seamlessly toward a sale.
          </p>
          <blockquote>“They needed to look like a brand from L.A., not just another listing site in Mexico.”</blockquote>

        {/* Section: Design and direction */}
        <FadeInOnScroll delay={150}>
          <h3>Design and direction</h3>
          <p>
            We started by creating a clean, modern brand identity—elegant fonts, warm color palettes, and full-bleed imagery
            reflecting Puerto Vallarta’s high-end lifestyle. The brand was built to evoke confidence and taste across all devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, I developed a custom <strong>WordPress site</strong> that prioritized immersive visuals, fast performance,
            and clear property calls to action.
          </p>
          <blockquote>“Design had to feel premium, but never overwhelming.”</blockquote>

        {/* Section: Multilingual AI sales support */}
        <FadeInOnScroll delay={200}>
          <h3>Multilingual AI sales support</h3>
          <p>
            One of Alpenglow’s biggest differentiators is its 24/7 sales support via a WhatsApp-enabled AI chatbot. I integrated
            a multilingual chatbot that can answer inquiries in hundreds of languages, instantly pulling from property data,
            FAQs, and lead intake flows.
          </p>
          <p>
            This allows international buyers to message the agency, get answers immediately, and begin a purchase journey—
            without waiting for a business-hour reply.
          </p>
          <blockquote>“It’s like having a real estate agent who never sleeps—and speaks 100 languages.”</blockquote>

        {/* Section: Engineering for the backend */}
        <FadeInOnScroll delay={250}>
          <h3>Engineering for the backend</h3>
          <p>
            The property listings weren’t straightforward. Alpenglow pulls from multiple MLS providers, each with different
            database formats and structures. I developed a custom WordPress theme tailored to interpret and display these listings
            cleanly—no matter the source.
          </p>
          <p>
            The backend was designed to be intuitive for their internal team, making it easy to manage properties without
            breaking the user experience or performance.
          </p>
          <blockquote>“Most MLS feeds are messy. We made them elegant.”</blockquote>

        <FadeInOnScroll delay={300}>
          <h3>The outcome</h3>
          <p>
            The result is a high-performing real estate platform that feels at home in a luxury market. International buyers
            can explore, inquire, and start the purchase process entirely from their phones—with confidence and clarity.

          <h3>Where we started</h3>
          <p>üìç <strong>Client:</strong> Solid Ground Construction</p>
          <p>
            Solid Ground Construction needed an affordable, reliable solution to create accurate bids and track budgets
            across multiple projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their existing processes relied heavily on spreadsheets and manual tracking, which made estimating and cost
            forecasting inefficient and error-prone.
          </p>
          <blockquote>‚ÄúThey needed a system that worked for their unique workflows‚Äînot a one-size-fits-all tool.‚Äù</blockquote>

        <FadeInOnScroll delay={150}>
          <h3>Research and direction</h3>
          <p>
            After exploring project management platforms, we chose to build a customized lightweight system using Google Business Suite.
            This gave the team flexible tools for organizing bids, tracking costs, and forecasting budgets‚Äîwithout heavy software overhead.
          </p>
          <blockquote>‚ÄúThe goal was to simplify complex data flows while keeping everything accessible to the whole team.‚Äù</blockquote>

        {/* Section: Implementation */}
        <FadeInOnScroll delay={200}>
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            To further optimize planning, I developed a custom Chrome extension that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provides an internal library of services and supplies</li>
            <li>Automatically loads supply lists into budgets when services are selected</li>
            <li>Integrates seamlessly with Google Sheets for real-time budget updates</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This innovation dramatically reduced manual entry and helped keep estimates consistent and transparent across projects.

        <FadeInOnScroll delay={250}>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Construction bidding requires high accuracy and adaptability. We had to ensure the system could scale with
            fluctuating supply costs and variable project scopes, all while remaining user-friendly for the team.

    <p>In Puerto Vallarta there are hundreds of property owners who manage just a few rentals and are losing huge amounts of time and money through fees by utilizing several booking sites.</p>
<p>A Bubble app that provides a unified website for tourists to rent from, property owners who want to attract clients on the popular apps but then bring them to their own site therefore evading expensive fees but providing a trustworthy comfortable experience for the clientele.</p>
<p>We incorporated Lodgify to manage properties from Booking.com, Aribnb and Vrbo so that our client was able to invite other hosts to list their properties on the app.</p>

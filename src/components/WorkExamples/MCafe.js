    <p>Iconic LA-based natural foods restaurant is launching ghost kitchen concept and needed online ordering capability for multiple brands in several locations with catering. In the over-crowded market of delivery fulfillment many restaurants are flailing with twelve software subscriptions and three KDS tablets losing time and struggling with fees.</p>
<p>Transferring to Toast POS combined website hosting with order management and POS integration, so all elements including marketing and reporting are easily managed with only one subscription fee.</p>    
<p>In order to align with an immediate location launch, I extended their current tech-stack to accommodate while completely rebuilding their website, menu and logistics infrastructure by transferring them from Revel to Toast POS systems.</p>
